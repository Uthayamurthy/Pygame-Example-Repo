# Pygame Example Repo
An example PyGame implementation which aims to teach basics of PyGame game development. The code in this repo is a functional reimplementation and enhancement of chimp example in offcial PyGame documentation (https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/ChimpLineByLine.html). 
 Additionally it contains a score system and title window.

## How to use this ?
Every python file contains an additional feature compared to the previous file. In the top of the file (as well in the index below), the purpose of the file is given. You are expected to start exploring from 1.py file by copy pasting the entire file and then copy paste only the additional code given in the next files (indicated by hashtags #) upto 9.py. 9.py as well as final.py contain the full code.
